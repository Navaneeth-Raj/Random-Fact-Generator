## Basic Details
### Team Name: INNOVATEX

### Project Description
"Life‚Äôs Most Useless Facts - A Random Fact Generator" is here to fill your day with the most irrelevant, mind-boggling trivia you‚Äôll never actually need! With just a click, discover facts so random they‚Äôll make you wonder, ‚ÄúWhy do I know this now?‚Äù

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
"Life's Most Useless Facts" solves the pressing issue of not having random, pointless trivia to brighten up dull moments or start the most bizarre conversations. It's the ultimate solution for anyone who needs a quick mental break, a quirky icebreaker, or just a laugh from the sheer absurdity of knowledge we don‚Äôt need but love to know!

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
The solution is built using a Python backend to fetch random, quirky facts from an external API, then delivers them to a playful HTML/CSS frontend with just a button click. Facts are stored in a MySQL database, where users can rate the "uselessness" of each fact, letting the app highlight the most absurd facts for future enjoyment!
