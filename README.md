### Project Description
"Life‚Äôs Most Useless Facts - A Random Fact Generator" is here to fill your day with the most irrelevant, mind-boggling trivia you‚Äôll never actually need! With just a click, discover facts so random they‚Äôll make you wonder, ‚ÄúWhy do I know this now?‚Äù

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
"Life's Most Useless Facts" solves the pressing issue of not having random, pointless trivia to brighten up dull moments or start the most bizarre conversations. It's the ultimate solution for anyone who needs a quick mental break, a quirky icebreaker, or just a laugh from the sheer absurdity of knowledge we don‚Äôt need but love to know!

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
The solution is built using a Python backend to fetch random, quirky facts from an external API, then delivers them to a playful HTML/CSS frontend with just a button click. Facts are stored in a MySQL database, where users can rate the "uselessness" of each fact, letting the app highlight the most absurd facts for future enjoyment!

## Technical Details
### Technologies/Components Used
For Software:
- Languages Used : HTML/CSS, Python, MySQL
- Frameworks Used : Flask
- Libraries Used : Flask, requests

For Hardware:
- Device : Any modern device that can support a web browser.
- Memory : Recommended RAM of 2GB
- Storage : Free space of 2MB

### Implementation
The Fact Generator uses Flask to handle routes and API requests. Facts are fetched from an external API (https://uselessfacts.jsph.pl/random.json) and displayed in the browser. Users can view a weekly fact and request additional random facts with a button click.
# Installation

git clone https://github.com/Navaneeth-Raj/Random-Fact-Generator

# Diagrams

The Random Fact Generator project workflow starts with the user clicking a button in their browser (HTML & CSS), which triggers JavaScript to request a fact from the Flask backend. Flask, running on Python, either fetches the fact from an external API or retrieves it from a database (if used). The fact is then sent back and displayed on the browser, completing the interaction.
